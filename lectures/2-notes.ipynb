    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will focus on multiple real covariates and single real responses\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensemble Learning (EL)\n",
    "\n",
    "* State-of-the-art\n",
    "* AdaBoost\n",
    "* Random Forest (try first this first)\n",
    "* XGBoost\n",
    "* CatBoost/LightGBM (quite new)\n",
    "* Deep Forest (quite new)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is ensemble learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weighted average of \"weak learners\"\n",
    "* For binary classification we can use sgn(sum(weak learners))\n",
    "* Multi-class classification can use majority vote\n",
    "* In practice, almost all Kaggle winners use ensemble learning\n",
    "* Ensemble learning can decrease bias, e.g. by boosting\n",
    "* Ensemble learning can decrease variance, e.g. by bagging\n",
    "* Ensemble learning can make an overall improvement, e.g. by stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "How to create different learners?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different learning algorithms\n",
    "* Different hyperparameters\n",
    "* Different representations\n",
    "* Different training sets\n",
    "* Artificial noise added to the data\n",
    "* Random samples from posterior of the model parameters (instead of finding the maximum)\n",
    "\n",
    "How to combine base learners?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting involves incrementally building an ensemble by training each new model instance to emphasize the training instances that previous models mis-classified. Each model corrects the mistakes of its predecessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bagging**\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneously construct a lot of the base models at the same time. The collection of base models vote on the final decision. The base models are distinguished by the datasets they have access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stacking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use predictions of a set of base learners as features in a higher-order model, a so called \"meta learner\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "The first practical boosting algorithm invented in 1995. Sequentially construct a set of base learners. Each sample has a weight, and the misclassified samples are emphasized more and more."
